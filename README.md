# README

This is a sample Rails application that simply demonstrates a turbo frame that promotes navigation to page visit, i.e., it restricts the page changes to the frame, but updates the URL as it changes on the frame.

## Running locally

```
bundle install
rails server
```

## Testing

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click next and previous pagination links
3. Notice that the current URL changes on the address bar
